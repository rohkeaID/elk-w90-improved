! Spin-spiral state for Gamma-Fe calculated supercells instead of the spiral
! Bloch state anzatz. This is required for functionals which do not preserve
! the anzatz self-consistently.

! The code runs in the same way as the phonon supercell calculations. The
! supercells are generated automatically from the q-points given by ngridq. Like
! phonons, several instances of the code can be started in the same directory,
! allowing for parallel generation of the q-dependent ground-states.

! Note that automatic k-point generation is always enabled for this task.
